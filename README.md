## General
In this repository I created a website that uses OpenWeather's API to display current weather conditions and a 5 day forecast for any city.

## Demo
!["Preview of site"](assets/WeatherDashboardDemo.gif)

## Usage
When you first land on the page it will show a list of cities on the left column with the first city's weather already loaded. You can click on either the other cities on the list or search your own city using the search bar. Doing this adds the city to the list, creating a history. When you come back to the site, the last city search will display.
